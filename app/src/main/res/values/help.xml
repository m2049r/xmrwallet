        <h1>Create Wallet - New</h1>
        <p>If you need a new Monero Address!</p>
        <p>Enter a unique wallet name and password.
        The password is used for securing your wallet data on the device. Use a strong password -
        even better use a passphrase.</p>
        <h2>Note your Mnemonic Seed!</h2>
        <p>On the following screen you will find your 25-word \"Mnemonic Seed\".
        This is the only data needed to recover your wallet at a later point
        and gain full access to your funds.
        Keeping this secure and private is very important, as it gives <em>anyone</em>
        full access to your funds!</p>
        <p>If you lose your wallet password, you can still recover your wallet with the Mnemonic Seed.</p>
        <p>There is no way to recover your Mnemonic Seed, if you lose it all your funds will be lost!
        The Mnemonic Seed can also never be changed, and if it is stolen or otherwise compromised,
        you will have to move your funds to new wallet (with a new Mnemonic Seed). Therefore, it is best
        that you backup your Mnemonic Seed by writing it down and storing it in <em>multiple</em> safe
        and secure places.</p>

        <h1>Wallet Details</h1>
        <h2>Public address</h2>
        Your public address is like your bank account number you can share this with anyone without
        having to fear losing your Monero. People will send Monero to your wallet using this address.
        <h2>Mnemonic Seed</h2>
        This is the only data needed to recover your wallet at a later point and gain full access to
        your funds. Keeping this private and secure is very important, as it gives <em>anyone</em> full
        access to your Monero! If you haven’t written this down somewhere safe please do!
        <h2>Wallet Files Recovery Password</h2>
        Make sure you write this password down. If you reset your device or uninstall the app, you
        will need it to access your wallet again.<br/>
        <h3>CrAzYpass</h3>
        If the password displayed here is 52 alphanumeric characters in groups of 4 - congratulations!
        Your wallet files are secured with a 256-bit key generated by your device&apos;s security
        features based on the passphrase you chose (on creation or by changing it). This makes it
        extremely difficult to hack!<br/>
        This feature is mandatory for all newly created wallets.
        <h3>Legacy Password</h3>
        If you see your passphrase here, your wallet files are not as secure as when using
        a CrAzYpass. To fix this, simply select \"Change Passphrase\" from the menu. After entering
        a new passphrase (maybe even the same one as before) the app will generate a CrAzYpass for
        you and secure your wallet files with it. Write it down!
        <h3>CrAzYpass wallets</h3>
        If you ever need to reinstall Monerujo (for example after resetting your phone or switching
        to a new one) or you want to use your wallet files on a different device or PC, you have to
        use this Recovery Password in order to access your wallet again.<br/>
        By selecting \"Change Passphrase\" from the menu, you can choose another passphrase. Beware
        that this will generate a new Recovery Password. Write it down!
        <h2>View key</h2>
        Your view key can be used to monitor incoming transactions to your wallet without giving
        permission to spend the funds inside your wallet.
        <h2>Spend key</h2>
        Your spend key allows anyone to spend the Monero associated with your wallet, so don’t tell
        anyone this key, keep it safe like your Mnemonic Seed.

        <h1>Wallet List</h1>
        <h2>Node</h2>
        <p>Monerujo uses a Remote Node to communicate with the Monero Network without having
        to download and store a copy of the whole blockchain itself. You can find a list of popular
        remote nodes or learn how to run your own remote node here https://moneroworld.com/<p>
        <p>Monerujo comes with some Remote Nodes preset. It remembers the last five nodes used.</p>
        <h2>Wallets</h2>
        <p>Here you see your wallets. They are located in the <tt>monerujo</tt> folder
        in the internal storage of your device. You can use a file explorer app to see them.
        You should make backups of this folder on a regular basis to off-device storage in
        case your device explodes or gets stolen.</p>
        <p>Select a wallet to open it or press the \"+\" to create a new one.
        Or select one of the wallet operations:</p>
        <h3>Details</h3>
        <p>Show the wallet details, seed &amp; keys.</p>
        <h3>Receive</h3>
        <p>Make a QR code for receiving Moneroj.</p>
        <h3>Rename</h3>
        <p>Rename the wallet. Backups are not renamed.</p>
        <h3>Backup</h3>
        <p>Make a copy of the wallet in the <tt>backups</tt> folder inside the <tt>monerujo</tt>
        overwriting previous copies there.</p>
        <h3>Archive</h3>
        <p>Make a backup and delete the wallet afterwards. The copy remains in the <tt>backups</tt>
        folder. If you no longer need your backups you should delete them with a file explorer or
        secure delete app.</p>

        This is the public address of the wallet you sent Monero to
        <h2>PaymentID</h2>
        You can use a Payment ID to identify the reason you sent Monero between two parties this is

        with an item you bought.
        <h2>TX ID</h2>
        This is your Transaction ID you can use it to identify your obfuscated transaction on a Monero
        Blockchain explorer like <a href="https://xmrchain.net/">https://xmrchain.net/</a>
        <h2>TX KEY (Transaction Key)</h2>
        This is your transaction private key, keep this safe as revealing this to a third party
        reveals which signature in a ring is yours, thereby making your transaction transparent.
        <h2>Block</h2>
        This was the block your transaction was included in.

        ensure you aren’t sending coins to the wrong address.</p>
        <p>In addition to sending XMR, you can send BTC through the XMR.TO service (see https://xmr.to

        <h1>Sending BTC</h1>
        <h2>XMR.TO</h2>
        <p>XMR.TO is a third party service which acts as an exchange from Monero to Bitcoin.
        We use the XMR.TO API to integrate Bitcoin payments into Monerujo. Please check out
        https://xmr.to and decide for yourself if this is something you want to use. The Monerujo
        Team is not associated with XMR.TO and cannot help you with their service.</p>
        <h2>XMR.TO Exchange Rate<h2>
        <p>On the \"Amount\" screen you will be shown the current parameters of the XMR.TO service. These
        include the current exchange rate as well as upper and lower BTC limits. Note that this
        rate is not guaranteed at this point. You will also see
        the amount up to which the BTC transaction will be executed instantly without waiting for
        XMR confirmations (see the XMR.TO FAQ for more details). Please note, that XMR.TO does
        not charge extra fees - how cool is that?</p>
        <h2>XMR.TO Order<h2>
        <p>On the \"Confirm\" screen, you will see the actual XMR.TO order. This order is valid for
        a limited time - you may notice a countdown on the \"Spend\" button. The exchange rate may
        be different to the indicative one shown on previous screens.</p>
        <h2>XMR.TO Secret Key<h2>
        <p>Since Monerujo only handles the Monero part of your transaction your XMR.TO secret key
        can be used to track the Bitcoin part of your order on the XMR.TO homepage.</p>
        <p>Please note, that this secret key is only valid for 24 hours after the transaction is
        started!</p>
        <h2>XMR.TO Countdown!</h2>

        <h1>The Wallet</h1>
        <h2>Street Mode</h2>
        <p>Street mode can be enabled/disabled in the menu or Gunther\'s head icon. In this mode, your
        balance is not shown on any screen so you can safely use your wallet on the street, a pub or
        other public place. Previous transactions are also hidden. New transactions will be shown, so
        you can see that you have sent/received sweet Moneroj!</p>
        <h2>Scanning</h2>
        Because Monero likes to keep things private, every time you open a Monerujo wallet we have to
        scan the blockchain to see if any new Moneroj have been sent to your wallet, this only
        stores information to your phone which belongs to your wallet. Sometimes it can take a while
        because you haven’t synced in a long time.
        <h2>The Balance</h2>
        <p><b>Help! My wallet balance has disappeared or is unconfirmed!</b><br/>
        Don’t panic! When you send funds from your wallet, some of your balance will temporarily show
        as unconfirmed.
        This happens as a result of how Monero is exchanged on the blockchain and how change works.
