<h3>The Eclipse Public License - v 1.0</h3>
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT&apos;S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br/>
<br/>
1. DEFINITIONS<br/>
<br/>
"Contribution" means:<br/>
<br/>
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
distributed under this Agreement, and<br/>
<br/>
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br/>
<br/>
i) changes to the Program, and<br/>
<br/>
ii) additions to the Program;<br/>
<br/>
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed
by that particular Contributor. A Contribution &apos;originates&apos; from a Contributor if it was
added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor&apos;s
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules
of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and
(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.<br/>
<br/>
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.<br/>
<br/>
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily
infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.<br/>
<br/>
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.<br/>
<br/>
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all
Contributors.<br/>
<br/>
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br/>
<br/>
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative
works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of
such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.<br/>
<br/>
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a
non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use,
sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,
in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of
the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,
such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents.
The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.
No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.<br/>
<br/>
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions
set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not
infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to
secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient&apos;s
responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br/>
<br/>
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its
Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.<br/>
<br/>
3. REQUIREMENTS<br/>
<br/>
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license
agreement, provided that:<br/>
<br/>
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br/>
<br/>
b) its license agreement:<br/>
<br/>
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions,
express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,
and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br/>
<br/>
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including
direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;<br/>
<br/>
iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor
alone and not by any other party; and<br/>
<br/>
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs
licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
software exchange.<br/>
<br/>
When the Program is made available in source code form:<br/>
<br/>
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br/>
<br/>
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br/>
<br/>
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.<br/>
<br/>
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a
manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the
Contribution.<br/>
<br/>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br/>
<br/>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end
users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the
commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial
product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for
other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial
product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and
indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the
acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to
any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering,
Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor
then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor&apos;s responsibility alone. Under this
section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors
related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor
to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.<br/>
<br/>
5. NO WARRANTY<br/>
<br/>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with
its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br/>
<br/>
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br/>
<br/>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL
HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/>
<br/>
7. GENERAL<br/>
<br/>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement,
and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br/>
<br/>
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the
Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient&apos;s patent(s), then such
Recipient&apos;s rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed.<br/>
<br/>
All Recipient&apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of
the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a
reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient&apos;s
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the
Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&apos;s obligations under this
Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
and survive.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid
inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner.
The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions)
of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the
right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward.
The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to
a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to
the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including
its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and
2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br/>
<br/>
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property
laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action
under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives
its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

    SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007<br />
    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>PREAMBLE<br />
    The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of
    collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and
    linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be
    shared and improved in partnership with others.</p>
<p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as
    long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
    bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
    names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be
    released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
    license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
<p>DEFINITIONS<br />
    &#8220;Font Software&#8221; refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s)
    under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts
    and documentation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reserved Font Name&#8221; refers to any names specified as such after the copyright
    statement(s).</p>
<p>&#8220;Original Version&#8221; refers to the collection of Font Software components as
    distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).</p>
<p>&#8220;Modified Version&#8221; refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or
    substituting&#8212;in part or in whole&#8212;any of the components of the Original Version,
    by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Author&#8221; refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other
    person who contributed to the Font Software.</p>
<p>PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS<br />
    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font
    Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and
    unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p>1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified
    Versions, may be sold by itself.</p>
<p>2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold
    with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this
    license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
    in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as
    those fields can be easily viewed by the user.</p>
<p>3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit
    written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only
    applies to the primary font name as presented to the users.</p>
<p>4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be
    used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the
    contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit
    written permission.</p>
<p>5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely
    under this license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement
    for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the Font
    Software.</p>
<p>TERMINATION<br />
    This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER<br />
    THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &#8220;AS IS&#8221;, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
